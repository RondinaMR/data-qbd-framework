description,"Often simply called Bank dataset in the fairness literature, this resource was produced to support a study of success factors in telemarketing of long-term deposits within a Portuguese bank, with data collected over the period 2008â€“2010. Each data point represents a telemarketing phone call and includes client-specific features (e.g. job, education), features about the marketing phone call (e.g. day of the week and duration) and meaningful environmental features (e.g. euribor). The classification target is a binary variable indicating client subscription to a term deposit."
